            <p>My name is Timothy Ayala. I am from Orlando, Florida, and I am currently a senior pursuing a degree in journalism, specializing in Sports Media. I hope to get into media law after undergrad, but I have developed skills across the board. Using the skills I developed in my Web Apps class this semester, I took the liberty of coding a webpage to showcase my graphic design as well as web design skills! Follow me on Instagram or x, or take a look at my LinkedIn to follow my journey.</p>
